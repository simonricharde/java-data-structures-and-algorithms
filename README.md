# Reverse an Array
Write java code to reverse an array using given array.

---

## Challenge
Do not use any inbuit function in java.  

---

## Approach And Efficiency

First find a length of a given array.
Write a java method to accept the arguments as given array and the length.
Define the result array of identified length.
Iterate the given array from Length-1 until the first element.
Store the each element in the reversed order.
Iterate through the result array and print each element.

# Array Shift

Write java code to Insert and shift an array in middle at index.

---

## Challenge
Do not use any inbuit function in java.  

---

## Approach And Efficiency

Find a length of a given array.
Find Middle index
Write a java method to accept the arguments as given array and the new item to be inserted.
Define a result array of length + 1
Iterate through inpu array using for loop
if iteration is equal to middle index then insert new item.
else insert each input array item to result item unless the iteration is not gretaer than middleindex.
If iteration is greater than middle index then insert i+1 index.
